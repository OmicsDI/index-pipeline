!Sample_extract_protocol_ch1 = RNA was extracted from 10 mL AF with 30 mL TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 8 mL chloroform. After RNA extraction, RNA was purified and DNA was removed using the RNeasy® Maxi Kit, including the DNase step according to the manufacturer’s protocol (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA).  RNA was precipitated using 3M NaOAc and 100% ethanol, and 80% ethanol was added after 4 hours incubation at -20 °C. cDNA, synthesized from extracted RNA, was amplified and purified using the WT-Ovation™ Pico RNA Amplification System (NuGEN, San Carlos, CA) and the DNA Clean & Concentrator™-25 (Zymo Research, Orange, CA).

!Sample_data_processing = Normalization was performed with the threestep command from the AffyPLM package in BioConductor, using ideal-mismatch background/signal adjustment, quantile normalization, and the Tukey biweight summary method.  To obtain detection calls consistent with those produced by Affymetrix' 5.0 software, we used the mas5calls function from the Bioconductor affy package.
